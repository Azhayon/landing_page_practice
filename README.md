# 🌐 Landing Page Practice

This repository contains multiple landing page projects I created while learning and practicing **HTML** and **CSS**.  
Each project is inspired by different tutorial videos to help me improve my front-end development skills and understand modern web layouts, responsive design, and styling techniques.

## 🧩 Projects Included
Each folder contains a separate landing page project with its own HTML, CSS, and assets.
